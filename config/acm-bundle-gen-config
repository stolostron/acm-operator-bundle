# This Bash fragment is sourced by various scripts.
#
# Its job is to set a bunch of configuration variables as expected by the
# bundle manifest generation scripts that source it. Because it is Bash, you
# can use any Bash constructs you want here, but be careful about setting
# variables that might break the sourcing script.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Config properties that are unique for each product (ACM vs. MCE)
# and often/occasionally differ release-to-release.
#
# Be sure to consider these settings in release-to-release cutovers.

# List or range of OCP versions to which bundles should be published.
# Note: This variable is used/effective only for CPASS builds. For Konflux
# builds, this range is now set in configuration files for the catalog
# generation steps.

# Note: ACM 2.11 is compatible with OCP 4.16.
# Official support covers [N+1, N-2], with [N-3/4] allowed as an exception.

# Since ACM 2.4:
cfg_supported_archs+=("s390x")
